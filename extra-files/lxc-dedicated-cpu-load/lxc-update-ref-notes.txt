/lib/systemd/system/lxcfs.service

This is now resolved. Whether to enable it default or not, will be decided later.

Willing users can enable this behaviour by editing:

Code:
/lib/systemd/system/lxcfs.service

and by adding the `-l` flag in ExecStart. Then restart service and containers.


/etc/systemd/system/lxcfs.service.d/override.conf


execute systemctl edit lxcfs

type following and save the file:

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/lxcfs -l /var/lib/lxcfs/

this will get automaticaly saved to /etc/systemd/system/lxcfs.service.d/override.conf file
note that the ExecStart= line deletes original definition, otherwise there would be two ExecStart statements after override is applied
to revert to default execute systemctl revert lxcfs

systemctl restart lxcfs.service
